Personal Dotfile Collection
===========================

My config files for Mac OS X and Linux.

Installation
------------

Uses `stow` for installation (`brew install stow` on a Mac, if you
have Homebrew installed already).

```bash
$ make
```

Configuration
-------------

Make sure to edit `git/.gitconfig` to contain your own name and email
address instead of mine.

Gibberish

I don't guarantee that nothing bad will happen if you use these
files. That said, I've certainly done nothing intentionally malicious.

Jack whatever code you want of course; give credit if I've done
something clever (I try to do the same)--props never hurt anyone.

On a personal note, *be kind to your command-line*; learn to love it.
It's your best link to the past and the closest you'll ever get to
wielding magic.  Harness the incantations and scare the common folk.
